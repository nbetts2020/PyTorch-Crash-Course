# PyTorch-Crash-Course
This crash course is designed for those with a proficiency in Python, aiming to bridge the gap to mastering PyTorch as a leading deep learning framework. Among the many topics we cover are:

  - What is PyTorch? Why is it used?
  - The basics of PyTorch (Tensors, Reshaping tensors, Broadcasting)
  - Building a Basic Neural Network (What are Layers?, Activation functions, Feed forward networks, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Datasets, DataLoaders)
  - Building an Advanced Neural Network (CNNs, RNNs, Cat vs. Dog Classification with the CIFAR-10 dataset, Evaluating Models)
  - Regularization and Optimization Techniques (Dropout, Batch Normalization, Learning Rate, Step Decay)
  - Transfer Learning
  - Text Classification with LSTMs
  - Inference with an R-CNN Object Detection Model
  - The Basics of Saving and Loading Trained Models (ONNX, TorchServe)
  - Fine-Tuning Transformer Based Architectures (Tokenizing a Dataset, GPT2-Medium, Text Completion, Repetitive Token Deterrence)

And much more!

Each topic is accompanied by detailed explanatory notes and code demonstrations that aim to give a comprehensive understanding of both the underlying theory, as well as its hands-on application. Furthermore, each new topic is paired with one or more links that offer additional information. 

# Getting Started
